"""One advantage of functions is the way they separate blocks of code from your main program.
You can go a step further by storing your functions in a separate file called a module and then importing that module
into your main program. An import statement tells Python to make the code in a module available in the currently
running program file. Storing your functions in a separate file allows you to hide the details of your programâ€™s code
and focus on its higher-level logic. It also allows you to reuse functions in many different programs.
